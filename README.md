    Hi! This is my Module 1 Challenge.  The goal of this assignment was mainly troubleshooting and overall cleanliness.  There was a link labeled "Seach Engine Optimization" that was not properly redirecting the user.  The class and Id tags associated with this link were messed up, but after fixing them the link should work properly.  The code was also not optimized, there were too many <div tags, when other tags would have been better suited.  I took the <Div tags out of the header and footer, and added in some <section tags to make the code neater and easier to read.
